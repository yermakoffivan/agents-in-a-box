//! Full-chain upgrade-from-populated test: every entity type seeded at an EARLY
//! migration, then the embedded migrator carried to head.
//!
//! `tripwire_migrations_apply.rs` only proves the migrations against a FRESH
//! database, and the per-migration `migration_00XX_upgrade.rs` tests each cover
//! ONE migration's effect on a narrow seed. Neither proves the real upgrade path
//! an existing install hits: a database that already holds rows for EVERY entity
//! type, carried across the WHOLE tail of the migration chain at once. A later
//! migration that drops or rewrites a table (a destructive rebuild like 0007's
//! `DROP TABLE beads_mapping`) would silently lose those rows, and nothing
//! catches it today.
//!
//! This test:
//!
//! 1. applies only migrations 0001..0009 — the EARLIEST point at which every
//!    entity table the parity bead names already exists (`autopilot` /
//!    `autopilot_run` first appear in 0009; `daemon_socket_token` and the new
//!    columns on `agent` / `issue` / `agent_task_queue` arrive only LATER, so
//!    they are deliberately NOT seeded here),
//! 2. inserts one representative row for EVERY seeded entity type — workspace,
//!    user, member, `agent_runtime`, agent, skill, issue, `agent_task_queue`
//!    (task), autopilot, `autopilot_run`, pat, `daemon_token`, and
//!    `beads_mapping` (a token / correlation row),
//! 3. runs `apply_migrations` to carry the database to head (0010..0016),
//! 4. asserts (a) the upgrade returns no error, (b) EVERY seeded row survives
//!    with its identity columns untouched and the columns added along the way
//!    read back their declared defaults, and (c) a SECOND `apply_migrations` is a
//!    pure no-op (idempotent — no row changes, no re-applied versions).
//!
//! # THE RULE
//!
//! **A migration that adds a CONSTRAINT must have a colliding-data case in this
//! seed, or the constraint is unproven.** One representative row per entity
//! cannot, even in principle, exercise the pre-flight de-collision a
//! constraint-adding migration needs; only data that actually collides can. The
//! seed below therefore carries adversarial shapes on purpose, and every new
//! `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` (or CHECK, or NOT NULL) landing on a table that already
//! exists at [`SEED_VERSION`] owes this file a colliding pair.
//!
//! ## Which constraints above `SEED_VERSION` this seed can collide (audited 0010..0067)
//!
//! | Migration | Constraint | Colliding seed possible? |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0012 | `idx_one_pending_task_per_issue_agent` on `agent_task_queue` | NO. It REPLACES 0004's strictly stricter one-pending-per-issue index, so any data legal at the seed schema is legal under it. A colliding pair cannot be inserted at seed time. |
//! | 0050 | `agent_workspace_name_unique` on `agent (workspace_id, name)` | YES, and it is seeded: two agents share a name in one workspace. |
//! | 0050 | `agent_system_identity_unique` on `agent (..., system_key)` | NO. Partial on `WHERE system_key IS NOT NULL`, and `system_key` is a column 0050 itself adds, so every pre-existing row is NULL and excluded. |
//! | 0016, 0017, 0027, 0037, 0061, 0063, 0066 | `label` / `squad` / `board` / `notify_rule` / `autopilot_rule_version` / `workspace_invitation` / `issue_property` unique indexes | NO. Each creates its table in the same migration, so it has no pre-existing rows to collide. |
//!
//! No migration in 0010..0067 converts an existing nullable column to NOT NULL:
//! `SQLite` cannot do that without a table rebuild and the whole set contains no
//! rebuild (no `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO`). The nearest real adversarial NULLs
//! are therefore seeded instead: a NULL `agent.instructions`, and a task with a
//! NULL `issue_id`, which is the excluded branch of BOTH partial pending-task
//! indexes (0004's and 0012's).
//!
//! `task_usage` (the other FK-pinning side named in the parity bead) lands only
//! at 0022, ABOVE the seed version, so it cannot be seeded here. The seeded
//! duplicate agent is FK-pinned from the two sides that DO exist at
//! [`SEED_VERSION`]: `agent_task_queue` and `autopilot`.
