//! TTL sweepers + stale-dispatch reclaim for the task FSM (P1.4).
//!
//! Three lifecycle states can get *stuck*: a `queued` task no runtime ever
//! claims, a `dispatched` task whose runtime crashed before it confirmed start,
//! and a `running` task whose agent hung. Each is bounded by a time-to-live;
//! when the TTL elapses the sweeper fails the row with
//! [`FailureReason::Timeout`](ainb_hangar_store::service::fail::FailureReason::Timeout).
//!
//! The dispatched state additionally has a **recovery window** (`task.go:82-85`):
//! the window must exceed the daemon's `StartTask` client timeout so an in-flight
//! claim is never reclaimed and double-dispatched. For the first 90s after
//! dispatch the task is therefore left **untouched** (the runtime may still be
//! confirming start). Once the dispatch outlives the window — `age >
//! reclaim_window` — the claim response is presumed lost and the task is
//! *reclaimed* (status back to `queued`, attempt unchanged) so a fresh runtime
//! can pick it up again. Only past the 5min dispatch TTL does a stuck dispatch
//! become a hard failure. A task that has already started (`started_at` stamped)
//! is never reclaimed — it is racing a live run.
//!
//! ```text
//!   dispatched_at        +90s            +5min
//!        │                │                │
//!   ─────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────▶ age
//!        │ recovery window │ reclaim → queued │ fail → timeout
//!        │ (skip: in-flight) │ (lost response) │ (runtime crashed)
//! ```
//!
//! All thresholds key off an injected [`HangarClock`] and a [`SweeperConfig`]:
//! production uses the reference defaults, tests inject a frozen clock and tight
//! config so the suite is deterministic (no `tokio::time::sleep`).
//!
//! # Idempotency
//!
//! Every statement constrains the source `status` in its `WHERE` clause, so a
//! terminal (`done` / `failed` / `cancelled`) row is never touched and a second
//! pass over the same backlog is a no-op once the rows have moved.
//!
//! Reference control-plane source-line references:
//! - queued TTL = 2h    (`runtime_sweeper.go:52`)
//! - running TTL = 2.5h  (`runtime_sweeper.go:40`)
//! - dispatched reclaim window = 90s (`task.go:85`)

// The TTL constants below are intentionally expressed in seconds: every
// threshold is a "minutes / hours" quantity but `Duration::from_mins` /
// `from_hours` are still unstable, and a raw second count is the clearest stable
// spelling for a timeout (and matches the reference source values cited beside
// each one).
