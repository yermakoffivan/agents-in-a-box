//! Fresh-home bootstrap: the idempotent default workspace + owner + runtime +
//! starter agent that make an empty `hangar.db` "just work".
//!
//! A brand-new `~/.agents-in-a-box/hangar.db` has no workspace, no runtime, and
//! no agent, so the TUI shows no runtime and the Squad screen rejects a create
//! with "no agent available to lead a squad". This module owns the ONE shared,
//! idempotent, non-destructive lay-down every entry point (the CLI's lazy
//! `issue create`, the daemon boot seed, and the `hangar/agent_create` RPC)
//! delegates to, so a workspace / runtime / owner is materialised in exactly one
//! place and the same way every time.
//!
//! # The stable-runtime invariant (correctness-critical)
//!
//! Every seeded / created agent binds the id [`ensure_runtime`] returns, and the
//! daemon's claim loop + self-register resolve the SAME id through that same
//! call. If they diverged, an agent would bind a runtime the daemon never claims
//! for and its tasks would never run. That one atomic upsert is the single source
//! of the id, so the callers cannot drift.
//!
//! A runtime **cannot be renamed** after first boot: `agent.runtime_id` is an
//! enforced `REFERENCES agent_runtime(id)` FK (sqlx sets `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`),
//! so an already-registered runtime's id always WINS over a changed
//! `HANGAR_DAEMON_RUNTIME_ID` / [`crate::bootstrap::DEFAULT_RUNTIME_ID`]. Only a brand-new
//! home adopts the configured id (again via [`ensure_runtime`], which RETURNS the
//! id it settled on); the daemon warns when it ignores a configured id.
//!
//! Every function here is idempotent and non-clobbering: it finds-or-creates and
//! never rewrites or deletes a user's own rows, so calling it on every boot is
//! safe.
